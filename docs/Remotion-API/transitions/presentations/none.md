# none()[v4.0.177](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/releases/v4.0.177)

A presentation that has no visual effect on it's own.  
Instead, you control the visual effect by using the [`useTransitionProgress()`](/docs/transitions/use-transition-progress).

## Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

```tsx
NoneTransition.tsx

import { linearTiming, TransitionSeries } from "@remotion/transitions";
import { none } from "@remotion/transitions/none";

const BasicTransition = () => {
  return (
    <TransitionSeries>
      <TransitionSeries.Sequence durationInFrames={40}>
        <Letter color="#0b84f3">A</Letter>
      </TransitionSeries.Sequence>
      <TransitionSeries.Transition
        presentation={none()}
        timing={linearTiming({ durationInFrames: 30 })}
      />
      <TransitionSeries.Sequence durationInFrames={60}>
        <Letter color="pink">B</Letter>
      </TransitionSeries.Sequence>
    </TransitionSeries>
  );
};Copy
```
