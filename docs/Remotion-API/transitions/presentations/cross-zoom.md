## Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

```tsx
CrossZoomTransition.tsx

import {linearTiming, TransitionSeries} from '@remotion/transitions';
import {crossZoom} from '@remotion/transitions/cross-zoom';

const BasicTransition = () => {
  return (
    <TransitionSeries>
      <TransitionSeries.Sequence durationInFrames={40}>
        <Letter color="#0b84f3">A</Letter>
      </TransitionSeries.Sequence>
      <TransitionSeries.Transition
        presentation={crossZoom({strength: 0.4})}
        timing={linearTiming({durationInFrames: 30})}
      />
      <TransitionSeries.Sequence durationInFrames={60}>
        <Letter color="pink">B</Letter>
      </TransitionSeries.Sequence>
    </TransitionSeries>
  );
};Copy
```
